This repository provides the implementation of **EcoDatum**, a data curation framework introduced in the paper [Quality over Quantity: Boosting Data Efficiency Through Ensembled Multimodal Data Curation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08211). EcoDatum enhances dataset quality by integrating various unimodal and multimodal data curation operators within a weak supervision ensemble framework, leading to improved model training efficiency.

## Introduction

In the era of big data, effectively curating web-crawled datasets is crucial for optimizing model performance. Traditional heuristic curation methods often fail to capture complex features, leading to biases and the exclusion of relevant data. EcoDatum addresses these challenges by strategically integrating various data curation operators within a weak supervision ensemble framework, utilizing automated optimization to score each data point effectively. This approach significantly improves data curation quality and efficiency, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques.
